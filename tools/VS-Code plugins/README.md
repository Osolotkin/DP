# Installation

To install the plugin/extension locally, use the `.vsix` file provided in each directory. There are two installation methods:

## Using the Command Line

```bash
code --install-extension <your_chosen_file>.vsix
```

(Note: `code` must be in your systemâ€™s PATH, which is typically set automatically during VS Code installation.)

## Through VS Code Interface

1. Open VS Code.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` by default).
3. Search for and select **"Install from VSIX..."**.
4. Choose the `.vsix` file you wish to install.
