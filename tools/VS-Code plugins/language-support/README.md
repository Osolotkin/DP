# Vi Language Support

Provides language detection and syntax highlighting for `.vi` files.

To enable highlighting, make sure the extension is installed and active. VS Code should automatically associate `.vi` files with the appropriate language mode.

If it does not:

1. Open a `.vi` file in VS Code.
2. Click on the language mode in the bottom-right corner.
3. Select **Configure File Association for '.vi'...**.
4. Choose `Vi` from the list.
